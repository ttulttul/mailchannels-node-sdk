## <a name="features">🚀 Features</a>

<!-- #region features -->
This SDK fully supports all features and operations available in the [MailChannels API](https://docs.mailchannels.net/). It is actively maintained to ensure compatibility and to quickly add support for new API features as they are released.

Some of the things you can do with the SDK:

- Send transactional emails
- Check DKIM, SPF & Domain Lockdown
- Configure DKIM keys
- Webhook notifications
- Manage sub-accounts
- Retrieve metrics
- Inspect webhook delivery batches
- Handle suppressions
- Run a local Email API simulator for development testing
- Configure inbound domains
- Manage account and recipient lists

> [!TIP]
> For a detailed reference mapping each SDK method to its corresponding MailChannels API endpoint reference, see the [SDK-API Mapping](https://mailchannels.yizack.com/sdk-api-mapping)

## <a name="requirements">📏 Requirements</a>

- [Create a MailChannels account](https://www.mailchannels.com/pricing/#for_devs)
- [Create an API key](https://console.mailchannels.net/settings/accountSettings#APIKeys)

## <a name="installation">📦 Installation</a>

Add `mailchannels-sdk` dependency to your project

```sh
# npm
npm i mailchannels-sdk

# yarn
yarn add mailchannels-sdk

# pnpm
pnpm add mailchannels-sdk
```

## <a name="local-simulator">🧪 Local simulator</a>

This repo includes a small local MailChannels Email API simulator at [scripts/email-api-simulator.js](./scripts/email-api-simulator.js). It keeps state in memory and emulates the SDK-supported Email API endpoints so you can test your application without calling the real MailChannels service.

### Start the simulator

```sh
# default: http://127.0.0.1:8787
pnpm simulate:email-api
```

You can override the bind address with environment variables:

```sh
MAILCHANNELS_SIMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1 MAILCHANNELS_SIMULATOR_PORT=8787 pnpm simulate:email-api
```

### Point the SDK at the simulator

Use the optional `baseUrl` constructor option when creating the client:

```ts
import { MailChannels } from 'mailchannels-sdk'

const mailchannels = new MailChannels('local-test-key', {
  baseUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8787'
})

const { data, error } = await mailchannels.emails.send({
  from: 'sender@example.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello from the simulator',
  html: '<p>Local test</p>'
})
```

### Run the example script

This repo also includes a runnable example at [playground/simulator/send.mjs](./playground/simulator/send.mjs) that points the SDK at the simulator, creates a DKIM key, sends a message, enrolls a webhook, and inspects webhook batches.

In one terminal:

```sh
pnpm simulate:email-api
```

In another terminal:

```sh
pnpm example:simulator
```

You can override the target URL and API key if needed:

```sh
MAILCHANNELS_SIMULATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 MAILCHANNELS_SIMULATOR_API_KEY=local-test-key MAILCHANNELS_SIMULATOR_WEBHOOK=http://127.0.0.1:9999/webhooks/mailchannels pnpm example:simulator
```

### What the simulator supports today

- Email sends and async sends
- Domain checks
- DKIM key create, list, rotate, and update
- Webhook enrollment, listing, validation, signing key lookup, and batch inspection
- Sub-account lifecycle, API keys, SMTP passwords, limits, and usage
- Engagement, performance, recipient behaviour, sender, volume, and usage metrics
- Suppression create, list, and delete

### Current limitations

- State is in-memory only and is reset when the process stops
- Any non-empty `X-API-Key` is accepted, with separate in-memory state per API key
- Webhook responses are simulated locally, but the simulator does not yet emit real webhook callbacks to your application

The next planned expansion is outbound webhook delivery so client applications can test webhook ingestion flows against the simulator as well.

## <a name="usage">📚 Usage</a>

To authenticate, you'll need an API key. You can create and manage API keys in **Dashboard** > **Account Settings** > **API Keys**.

Pass your API key while initializing a new MailChannels client.

```ts
import { MailChannels } from 'mailchannels-sdk'

const mailchannels = new MailChannels('your-api-key')
```

Send an email:

```ts
const { data, error } = await mailchannels.emails.send({
  from: 'Name <from@example.com>',
  to: 'to@example.com',
  subject: 'Test email',
  html: '<p>Hello World</p>'
})
```

## <a name="naming-conventions">📐 Naming Conventions</a>

<!-- #region naming-conventions -->
Most properties in the MailChannels API use `snake_case`. To follow JavaScript conventions, the SDK adopts `camelCase` for all properties. This means:

- Most options and responses match the API docs, but field names are `camelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
- Some fields are grouped into nested objects or renamed for simplicity and better developer experience.
- While most fields match the API docs (just with `camelCase`), a few may be simplified or reorganized to feel more natural for JavaScript developers.
